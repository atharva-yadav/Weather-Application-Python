# Weather Application Using Python

This is a real-time weather forecast app that returns the current temperature, maximum and minimum temperature, humidity, and wind speed of the searched city. In addition to this, the application provides an amazing user interface.

### Modules used in this project:
1. **Tkinter**: To create this Graphical User Interface (GUI), I have used a Python `Tkinter` Library which allows to insert text boxes, various texts, buttons, etc.
2. **PIL**: PIL is the Python Imaging Library which provides the python interpreter with image editing capabilities.
3. **json**: API response in in the form of `json`. So, to handle it, this module is used. Thiscomes built in with Python.
3. **requests**: It is used for making HTTP requests to a specified URL. This module does not comes built in with Python. To install it type the below command in the terminal.

I have used [**Openweathermap API**](https://openweathermap.org/api) which simply accepts a name of location where weather need to fetched and the API key.
